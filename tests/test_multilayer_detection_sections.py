"""Structural checks for multilayer-detection.qmd (ticket 0057).

The companion paper (QSS submission, epic 0026) presents a lean six-method
design for endogenous periodization. Its Method section (§4) must cover
nine subsections in a fixed order; its Results section (§5) is stubbed until
the compute pipeline fills numbers (ticket 0064).

Keep this test mechanical: substring presence in the source .qmd.

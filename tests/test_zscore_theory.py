"""Theory tests for cross-year Z-score bias under non-stationarity.

These tests verify mathematical facts about the cross-year Z-score, not code
behavior. They serve as documentation (the proposition is true) and as
regression guards (the proof algebra stays correct if this file is modified).

See deliverables/_shared/_includes/techrep/null-model.md §Two notions of Z-score for the
formal statement and proof.

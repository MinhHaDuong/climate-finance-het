# Roadmap

## North star

Building toward a book on international climate finance between solidarity and profit. This repo is the research infrastructure: a 30K-work corpus, analysis pipeline, and the articles that test each piece of the argument before it becomes a chapter.

## Next articles

- [ ] **Paper 4 — Multilingual: "Whose evidence shapes climate policy?"** (ticket 0014) — Empirical finding paper. The $300B NCQG was constructed from English-indexed scholarship alone; Chinese (South-South, Belt-and-Road) and Brazilian (deforestation finance) traditions were invisible. Two-axis design (language × geography) disentangles linguistic from epistemic barriers. Blocked on Paper 5 (corpus v2.0). Journals: Global Environmental Change, World Development, Nature Climate Change Analysis. Supersedes the older "epistemic blind spots" framing (multilingual-paper epic on hold per ticket 0001).
- [ ] **Paper 5 — Corpus v2.0** (ticket 0013) — Add CNKI (Chinese) and SciELO (Portuguese/Spanish) to raise non-English share from 7% to 20-30%. Enables Paper 4. Journal TBD; methods-heavy, Scientometrics or QSS if submitted standalone.
- [ ] **Paper 3 — Companion methods paper** (epic 0026) — Multi-layer detection and validation of structural change in text corpora. Lean 6-method panel across 3 layers (embedding / lexical / graph) with permutation Z-scores and transition zones. Wave C in flight, blocked on 0042 pipeline rerun. Journal: Quantitative Science Studies (QSS, chosen).
- [ ] **OECD vs. Oxfam** — How do competing accounting frameworks produce divergent truths from the same financial flows? Contribution: a sociology-of-quantification case study showing how measurement conventions perform political positions on North-South climate debt. Requires document-to-evidence extraction capabilities (cf. [AEDIST](https://github.com/MinhHaDuong/aedist) stage 2). Journals: Accounting, Organizations and Society; Social Studies of Science.
- [ ] **MDB greening pivot** — How did multilateral development banks reframe existing portfolios as "climate finance" without changing what they fund? Contribution: an economization analysis of institutional relabeling as performative category work. Requires document-to-evidence extraction capabilities (cf. AEDIST stage 2). Journals: Review of International Political Economy, New Political Economy.
- [ ] **Carbon markets as failed performativity** — Why did the CDM fail to produce the efficient abatement market it modeled, and is Article 6 repeating the same design flaws? Contribution: a MacKenzie-style analysis of how market devices for North-South carbon transfers failed to perform the world they assumed. Journals: Economy and Society, Journal of Cultural Economy.
- [ ] **Sectoral deals vs. global targets** — Why are sector-by-sector technology cooperation agreements more effective than aggregate financial pledges? Contribution: a comparative policy analysis using the Montreal Protocol as benchmark, arguing the NCQG $300bn target repeats the $100bn's structural failure. Journals: Climate Policy, Global Environmental Politics.

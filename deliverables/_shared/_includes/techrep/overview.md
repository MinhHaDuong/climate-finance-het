# Overview

This document surveys the structural break detection methods applied to the climate finance corpus
({{< meta corpus_total >}} works, 1990--2024).
Each method answers the same question in a different vocabulary:
*does the distribution of works written before year $t$ differ from the distribution of works written after $t$?*
We apply a sliding window of $w$ years on each side of the candidate break year, excluding year $t$ itself from both windows: Before: $[t-w,\, t-1]$; After: $[t+1,\, t+w]$.^[Throughout this report we show $w \in \{2, 3, 4\}$. The companion paper reports $w=3$ as the default lead window, with $w \in \{2, 4\}$ as robustness checks. Year $t$ is excluded from both windows (gap = 1) so that the split year is a clean boundary rather than a member of the "before" distribution.]

Methods are grouped into three layers:

- **Part S — Semantic.** Compare full embedding distributions: each work is a point in the BAAI/bge-m3 embedding space ({{< meta emb_dimensions >}} dimensions). These methods detect distributional shift in *what the field talks about*.
- **Part L — Lexical.** Compare TF-IDF vocabulary distributions. Complementary to semantic methods; more interpretable (discriminating terms are directly readable).
- **Part G — Citation graph.** Compare citation network topology: degree distributions, community structure, centrality. These methods detect changes in *how knowledge flows* rather than *what is said*.
- **C2ST (Classifier two-sample tests).** C2ST\_embedding lives in Part S; C2ST\_lexical lives in Part L. Each asks the same meta-check question — can a classifier distinguish "before" from "after" better than chance? — in its respective feature space.

## Growing-corpus bias and equal-n debiasing

The climate finance corpus grew roughly 15× between 1995 and 2020, so the "after"
window for any anchor year $t$ systematically contains more papers than the "before"
window. This asymmetry introduces two problems.

**Variance imbalance.** For a distance statistic $D$ estimating $d(P_\text{before},
P_\text{after})$, the finite-sample estimator has variance $O(1/n_\text{before} +
1/n_\text{after})$. When $n_\text{after} \gg n_\text{before}$ (early anchor years) or
$n_\text{before} \gg n_\text{after}$ (late anchor years, where indexing lag shrinks
the after window), the estimator variance is dominated by whichever sample is smaller.
The effective precision is limited by the minority window no matter how large the
majority window grows.

**Size-dependent bias.** Many statistics — including energy distance, MMD, and
JS divergence — have non-zero expected value under the null $d = 0$ when
$|1/n_\text{before} - 1/n_\text{after}|$ is large [@gretton2012; @perezcruz2008].
The bias is not an artefact of a true shift; it is a finite-sample effect that grows
with the size imbalance. Without correction, the series would show artificially
elevated divergence in early and late years simply because the two windows are unequal
in size.

**Equal-$n$ subsampling.** Before computing $D$, we subsample the larger window to
$\min(n_\text{before}, n_\text{after})$ papers, drawn without replacement. This
equalises both the variance contribution and eliminates the size-dependent bias
component. The cost is a power loss proportional to the dropped fraction — largest in
the early and late years of the corpus where imbalance is greatest. To reduce the
variance introduced by a single random draw, we repeat the subsampling $R = 3$ times
and take the median: the reported statistic is the median over three independent draws
at each anchor year.

**Configuration.** Equal-$n$ subsampling is controlled by `divergence.equal_n: true`
in `config/analysis.yaml` (default). It can be disabled at runtime with
`--no-equal-n` to reproduce the biased series and assess the magnitude of the
correction.

## Minimum sample requirements per method family {#sec:min-sample}

The pipeline enforces a global floor of `min_papers=30` per window before computing any statistic. The threshold is pragmatic — it avoids degenerate inputs — but its reliability varies by method family. Two methods have higher per-method overrides in `config/analysis.yaml`.

**Semantic (S1--S4).** Energy distance (S2) and MMD (S1) are U-statistics: consistent for $n \geq 2$, with power growing as $O(1/\sqrt{n})$. For a medium effect size ($\delta = 0.5$ mean shift in standard deviation units), power reaches 80\% near $n \approx 30$; the global minimum is adequate. Sliced Wasserstein (S3) converges at the same $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ rate per projection; $n=30$ yields crude but usable trend estimates. Fréchet distance (S4) is the exception: it fits a multivariate Gaussian to each window, which requires $n > d$ for the covariance matrix to be full-rank. With PCA reduction to `max_dim=256`, covariances computed from $n < 300$ papers are rank-deficient or numerically fragile. The pipeline therefore sets `min_papers=300` for S4\_frechet; years with fewer papers in a window are skipped.

**Lexical (L1--L3).** TF-IDF vocabulary distributions are sensitive to vocabulary size and occupancy. At $n=30$, many terms appear only once, inflating JS divergence (L1). Adequate power requires $n \geq 50$; the pipeline emits a low-$n$ warning when `n_min < 50` in a lexical window pair (see `low_n_threshold` in config). The global `min_papers=30` allows computation but the result should be interpreted cautiously. See ticket 0099 for the dimension--sample ratio derivation.

**Citation graph (G1--G9).** Graph methods require a connected subgraph. At $n=30$ with typical citation density ($\bar{k} \approx 5$ in-citations per paper), the mean in-degree is $\bar{k}/n \approx 0.17$, which is above the subcritical threshold for Erdős--Rényi random graphs ($\lambda = 1$ requires $\bar{k} > 1$). In practice, the giant component exists at $n=30$ for this corpus. Community detection (G9) needs at least two non-trivial communities; at $n=30$, the modularity landscape is noisy but not degenerate. The global minimum of 30 is adequate for graph methods.

**C2ST.** With `cv_folds=5`, each fold holds out one-fifth of papers per class. At $n=30$ balanced, the smallest test fold has $30 / (2 \times 5) = 3$ papers — far too few for stable AUC estimation. Reliable AUC requires at least 5--10 papers per test fold, implying $n \geq 50$ (giving $\geq 5$ per class per fold). The pipeline sets `min_papers=50` for C2ST; years below this threshold are skipped.

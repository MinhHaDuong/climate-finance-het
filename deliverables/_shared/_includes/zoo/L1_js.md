## L1. Jensen-Shannon Divergence (TF-IDF) {#sec-l1}

### Principle

JS divergence compares two probability distributions over a shared vocabulary.
We aggregate the TF-IDF vectors of all works in each window into a "bag of words" distribution,
then measure how much information is needed to encode one distribution using the other as a model.
JS divergence is the symmetrised, bounded version of Kullback-Leibler divergence.

### Definition

$$\text{JS}(P \| Q) = \frac{1}{2} D_{KL}(P \| M) + \frac{1}{2} D_{KL}(Q \| M), \quad M = \frac{P+Q}{2}$$

where $P$ and $Q$ are the normalised mean TF-IDF vectors of the before/after windows,
$D_{KL}(P\|Q) = \sum_i P_i \log(P_i / Q_i)$, and sums run over the vocabulary.
$\text{JS} \in [0, \log 2]$; the square root is a proper metric.

### Advantages, biases, limitations

**Advantages.** Interpretable: dominant terms in each distribution are directly readable. Bounded ($\leq \log 2$). No hyperparameter. Consistent with the semantic energy distance on this corpus (same convergence signal).

**Biases.** Vocabulary changes over time (new terms, deprecated terms); TF-IDF weights are computed on the full corpus and re-applied to sub-windows, so rare early terms may dominate early-window distributions. Aggregation to mean TF-IDF discards within-window heterogeneity.

**Limitations.** Ignores word order and semantic similarity (synonyms treated as distinct tokens).

**Smoothing:** Both the before- and after-period term-frequency distributions receive additive epsilon smoothing ($\varepsilon = 10^{-10}$) before computing the Jensen–Shannon divergence, preventing $\log(0)$ errors and bounding the statistic away from its theoretical maximum of $\log 2$.

**Vocabulary dimension and sample size:** The TF-IDF vocabulary has up to $D = 5{,}000$ dimensions (after `min_df = 3` pre-filtering). A typical window contains $n = 150$–$400$ documents. The expected number of distinct vocabulary terms observed in a window of $n$ documents averaging $L \approx 150$ words is $D \cdot (1 - e^{-nL/D})$; at $n=200$ this gives approximately 98% occupancy — most terms appear at least once. Individual frequency estimates are noisier: a term observed $k$ times has relative standard error $\sim 1/\sqrt{k}$, so terms with $k < 4$ (filtered by `min_df = 3` at fit time, but not per-window) contribute mostly noise. When $n < 50$, the per-window effective vocabulary shrinks further, degrading JS divergence estimates; a warning is logged in this case.

### Corpus results

*Cross-year Z-score for L1 (JS-TF-IDF), w=2–5.*

Key values (w=3): peak $Z = +2.7$ at 1998, monotonic decline. Same convergence pattern as S methods.
